= Prerequisites to install Nuvolaris in a Kubernetes cluster

You can install Nuvolaris in any Kubernetes cluster which xref:prereq-cluster.adoc[satisfy some requirements].

Kubernetes clusters are  available pre-built from a variety of cloud providers. We provide with our `nuv` tool the commands to install a Kubernetes cluster ready for Nuvolaris in the following environments:

* xref:prereq-eks.adoc[Amazon EKS]
* xref:prereq-aks.adoc[Azure AKS]
* xref:prereq-gke.adoc[Google GKE]
* xref:prereq-osh.adoc[RedHat OpenShift]

You can also provision a suitable cluster by yourself, in any cloud or on premises, ensuring the prerequites are satisfied.

Once provisioned, you will receive a configuration file to access the cluster, called `kubeconfig`.

This file should be placed in `~/.kube/config` to give access to the cluster

If you have this file, you can check if you have access to the cluster with the command:

----
nuv debug kube info
----
 
You should see something like this:

====
Kubernetes control plane is running at https://xxxxxx.yyy.us-east-1.eks.amazonaws.com
==== 

Once you have got access to the Kubernetes cluster, either installing one with out commands or provisioning one by yourself, you can proceed xref:configure.adoc[configuring the installation] and then xref:install-cluster.adoc[installing Nuvolaris] in the cluster.
