= Prerequisites to install Nuvolaris in a Linux server

You can install Nuvolaris on any server either in your intranet or on in Internet running a Linux distribution, with the following requirements:


. You know the **IP address or DNS name** of the server on Internet or in your Intranet.
. The server requires at least 8GB of memory and 30GB of disk space available.
. It should be running a Linux distribution https://docs.k3s.io/installation/requirements[supported by K3S].
. You must open the firewall to access ports   80, 443 and 6443 (for K3S) or 16443 (for MicroK8S) from your machine. 
. You have to install a <<sshkey, public ssh key>> to access it without a password.
. You have to configure <<sudo, sudo>> to execute root commands without a password.


You can:

* get a server on any cloud provider or even install by yourself and then xref:prereq-server-generic.adoc[configure it]
* provision such a server with `nuv` xref:prereq-server-aws.adoc[on Amazon Web Services]
* provision such a server with `nuv` on xref:prereq-server-gcp.adoc[on Google Cloud Platform]

Once you have such a server you can optionally (it is not required) install xref:prereq-k3s.adoc[K3S] or xref:prereq-mk8s.adoc[MicroK8S] in it.



Once you have configured you server, you can proceed xref:configure.adoc[configuring Nuvolaris] for the installation.
