## Open Source Project
{.text-left}

Apache OpenServerless is an open-source project, released under the Apache License 2.0. It provides a portable and complete serverless environment, enabling the rapid and easy development of cloud-native applications.

Our goal is to make OpenServerless ubiquitous, allowing it to run easily in a complete and portable environment across any Kubernetes deployment.

OpenServerless is based on Apache OpenWhisk, which offers a powerful, production-ready serverless engine.

## Serverless to Begin
{.text-left}

The serverless engine is just the beginning. A serverless environment requires a set of integrated services. OpenServerless, integrated with OpenWhisk, includes several additional services such as databases, object storage, and a cron scheduler.

We test it on many public cloud Kubernetes services and on-premises Kubernetes vendors. The platform is paired with a powerful CLI tool, `nuv`, which lets you deploy quickly and easily everywhere, and perform a lot of development tasks.

Our goal is to build a complete distribution of a serverless environment with the following features:

- Easy to install and manage
- Integrates all key services for application development
- Highly portable to run on any Kubernetes environment

It is regularly tested against a set of supported Kubernetes environments. If you want to know more about our goals, check our roadmap document.
